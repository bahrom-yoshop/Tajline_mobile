The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the TAJLINE.TJ application into a robust cargo management system, demonstrating a highly iterative and user-feedback-driven development approach. Key accomplishments include implementing a comprehensive courier management system with GPS tracking, refining cargo acceptance workflows for operators, and adding mass deletion functionality for various entities. The engineer adeptly handled full-stack challenges, from resolving FastAPI route conflicts and Pydantic validation issues in the backend to addressing complex React UI rendering bugs,  null reference errors, and data synchronization problems in the frontend. This involved significant code refactoring and the creation of new endpoints and UI components, ensuring the system reached a production-ready state for core features. The work concluded with an attempt to resolve an issue where the warehouse list was not displaying, indicating a potential problem with data fetching on the frontend.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application is a full-stack cargo management system designed for Moscow-Tajikistan routes, catering to Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles. Its core purpose is to manage the entire cargo lifecycle, encompassing unique numbering, QR scanning, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), financial tracking, and real-time notifications.

Recent feature developments and fixes focused on:
1.  **Courier Operations**: Implementing a dedicated courier role, an admin panel for courier management, real-time GPS tracking, operation history, and personal profiles.
2.  **Cargo Acceptance**: Enhancing the  form to include detailed pickup information, enabling Send to Courier functionality, and creating an operator acceptance modal to display courier-filled recipient info, detailed cargo items with weight/price, payment fields, and QR/label print buttons.
3.  **Workflow Refinements**: Expanding cargo categories to include Accepted Cargo and Picked Up Cargo with relevant actions, and streamlining the Cargo Pickup form.
4.  **Warehouse Management**: Processing delivered pickup requests, notifying operators, and displaying them in Размещенные грузы (Placed Cargo).
5.  **UI/UX Improvements**: General UI refinements, adding chat features, company branding, user profiles, mobile responsiveness, and fixing specific display issues like the Наименование груза field.
6.  **Redundancy Removal**: Eliminating the duplicate Продолжить оформление modal to simplify operator workflow.
7.  **Mass Deletion**: Implementing mass deletion for warehouses, cargo items, and pickup requests.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing issues related to the warehouse management section. The user reported that Список складов не показвает склады (The list of warehouses does not show warehouses).

The AI engineer's last action was attempting to locate the main  hook in  to ensure that the  function is called upon component load, which is crucial for populating the warehouse list. The engineer performed multiple  and file read commands across  to locate the appropriate place for this API call.

Specifically, the engineer was looking for:
-   
-   
-   
-   

The goal is to ensure the  function, which fetches warehouse data from  (newly added endpoint) and populates the UI, is invoked when the component mounts. This is expected to resolve the user's reported issue of an empty warehouse list.

<optional_next_step>
Locate the main  hook in  and ensure  is called on component mount.
