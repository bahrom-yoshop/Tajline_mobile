The previous AI engineer successfully tackled a series of complex issues and feature enhancements for the TAJLINE.TJ application. The core focus was on refining the cargo placement and tracking system, particularly the warehouse layout visualization. Key challenges involved resolving data inconsistencies where the warehouse layout API and statistics were pulling from incorrect or outdated collections, leading to discrepancies between actual placements and displayed information. The engineer implemented robust data migration and cleaning strategies to synchronize  with  and  collections. Frontend updates ensured the interactive warehouse scheme accurately displayed cargo, including detailed information and removal functionality. Additionally, critical fixes included enabling placement of unpaid cargo and correctly displaying cargo names during QR scanning. The work was iterative, often requiring deep dives into backend logic and data states to diagnose and rectify issues, with a strong emphasis on continuous testing and user feedback. The final phase addressed filtering fully placed requests from Ready for Placement and ensuring accurate data display on request cards.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application is a cargo management system for Moscow-Tajikistan routes, supporting Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles. Its primary goal is to streamline the cargo lifecycle from acceptance to placement and tracking.

**Initial Implemented Features:**
*   Cargo Acceptance & QR Management.
*   Cargo Placement (Scanner) with enhanced UI/UX.
*   Placement Progress & Analytics.
*   Cargo List Management: Placed cargo requests move to Список грузов.
*   Developer Numbering System for debugging.
*   Размещенный груз (Placed Cargo) feature under Склады for viewing placed units.
*   Menu Renaming/Restructuring: Список грузов removed, Размещение груза renamed to Готов к размещению, Размещение renamed to Размещение груз.

**New Feature (Warehouse Layout Scheme) & Fixes Implemented in this Trajectory:**
*   **Enhanced Warehouse Layout Visualization:** Improve Просмотр схемы склада accessed from Склады -> Список складов.
*   **Interactive Cells:** Visually represent occupied/free cells.
*   **Detailed Cargo Information on Click:** Clicking an occupied cell must display quantity, request number, cargo number, name, recipient, placing operator, and delivery city.
*   **Accurate Placement Display:** Correctly show genuinely placed cargo, resolving issues with TEMP cargo and missing items.
*   **Cargo Removal Functionality:** Implement a Delete cargo from cell button in the cell details modal.
*   **Correct Warehouse Card Statistics:** Fix incorrect occupied cell count on warehouse cards in Список складов (e.g., showing 10 instead of 2).
*   **Allow Placement of Unpaid Cargo:** Remove the restriction that prevents operators from placing cargo if its payment status is not paid.
*   **Display Cargo Name on QR Scan:** When scanning a QR code for cargo placement, the cargo's name should be displayed instead of Неизвестно.
*   **Filter Fully Placed Requests:** Remove requests where all individual units are placed from the Грузы -> Готов к размещению list and the Individual Units карточки display mode.
*   **Accurate Data on Карточки заявок**: Ensure precise placement data is shown on the request cards.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's feedback concerning the Грузы -> Готов к размещению section. Specifically, the user reported that the Individual Units карточки view still displayed fully placed requests (e.g., 25082235, 25082298), which should be hidden. Additionally, the user requested an update to the data displayed on the Карточки заявок mode regarding placed items and their quantities.

The AI engineer had already:
1.  **Diagnosed the issue**: Found that the  API was not filtering out fully placed requests, and the data displayed on cards (, ) might not be accurately reflecting .
2.  **Modified **:
    *   Updated  to filter out fully placed requests at the cargo level, ensuring that requests with all units placed are no longer shown in the Individual Units view.
    *   Updated the logic within  to ensure  and  calculations for Карточки заявок are based on accurate  data, not just  flags in .
3.  **Performed Backend Testing**: Initial testing confirmed that the filtering for fully placed requests (e.g., 25082235) in  was working correctly, and partially placed requests (e.g., 250101) were shown. However, the testing summary also indicated problems with data synchronization between placement_records and individual_items and that critical problems still exist, even though the main filtering logic works!.

The very last user message explicitly stated: Точных данных о размещении в режиме Карточки заявок (Accurate data on Request Cards mode), indicating that despite the filtering logic fixes, the *displayed data* on these cards regarding placement might still be incorrect or require further refinement to reflect precise information.
