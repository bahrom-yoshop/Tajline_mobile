The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer on the TAJLINE.TJ application, focusing on two main phases. Initially, the engineer implemented a developer numbering system (DevBadge, DevControl) to facilitate UI element identification and communication, addressing initial React DOM errors through refactoring component placement and styling. This system was verified via screenshots. Subsequently, the engineer tackled a critical bug where fully placed cargo requests (e.g., Заявка 250109) did not correctly move from the placement list to the Cargo List and displayed incorrect progress. This required significant modifications to both frontend () to accurately calculate and display placement progress based on  status, and backend () to correctly filter available cargo and provide accurate placement status. Backend fixes were thoroughly tested, confirming correct filtering and data synchronization. The frontend was restarted, and the user opted to manually verify the UI changes.

The TAJLINE.TJ application is a cargo management system designed for Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles, primarily for Moscow-Tajikistan routes, focusing on efficient cargo handling.

**Core Problem Solved:** Efficient cargo lifecycle management from acceptance to placement and tracking.

**Implemented Features & Details:**
*   **Cargo Acceptance:** Refined form and process.
*   **QR Code Management:** Generation/printing of unique QR codes (e.g., xxxxxxxx/xx/xx format) for individual/batch items, with UI for numbering.
*   **Cargo Placement (Scanner):** Redesigned UI/UX for individual unit placement, supporting new QR formats, multi-item scanning, auto-focus, and instant feedback.
*   **Placement Progress & Analytics:** Displays overall (Placed: X/Y) and per-request progress, with detailed statistics (completion %, remaining units, operator, location, time).
*   **Scanner Robustness:** Automatic character filtering and field clearing.
*   **Navigation Enhancements:** Counters on sidebar menu items.
*   **Cargo List Management:** Fully placed cargo requests now correctly move from the placement list to Список грузов (Cargo List), maintaining individual item cards and settings. This involved correcting backend filtering logic and frontend progress calculation.
*   **Developer Numbering System:** Implemented a UI numbering system (e.g., P001, F001) for pages, forms, modals, and cards, activatable via URL or localStorage, to aid development and debugging.

-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: FastAPI backend handling API endpoints, data models, and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   ****: Modified filtering logic to correctly exclude cargo requests where all  have . This ensures fully placed requests move out of the available for placement list.
        -   ****: Updated to generate  from the actual  array in the cargo document, correctly reflecting their  status.
        -   ****: (Previous work, confirmed relevant) Explicitly sets  status to  for corresponding  within the main cargo document for data consistency.

    -   **Summary**: Main React component managing routing, state, authentication, and UI rendering.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Developer Numbering Integration**: Added imports for  and . Integrated  at the root of the app. Added  components to various UI elements (Login page/form, Registration form, Loading page, Placement page, Dashboard, Courier panel, Cargo Acceptance Modal/Form, Statistics Cards), with specific numerical IDs.
        -   **React DOM Error Fixes**: Adjusted  positioning (from  to ) and  styling to resolve / errors, and corrected component nesting for  within the Cargo Acceptance Modal.
        -   **Cargo Progress Display Fix**: Modified logic for displaying placement progress on Карточки заявок to accurately calculate placed items by checking the  status of  directly from the  data, rather than relying on potentially outdated .
        -   **Placement Details Modal Fix**: Updated logic within the Детальное размещение modal to correctly display overall and per-type cargo progress by iterating through  and checking their  status.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed a critical bug where fully placed cargo requests were not moving from the placement list to the Список грузов (Cargo List), and their progress was incorrectly displayed, specifically for Заявка 250109.

The work involved:
1.  **Backend Fixes ():**
    *   The  API was modified (lines 5998-6017) to correctly filter out cargo requests where *all*  are marked as , ensuring they no longer appear in the placement list.
    *   The  API was updated (lines 6790-6850) to dynamically generate individual unit statuses based on the actual  flags within the cargo document's  array, rather than recalculating based on .
    *   Backend testing confirmed these fixes, showing that Заявка 250109 was correctly excluded from the placement list and the status API returned accurate data.
2.  **Frontend Fixes ():**
    *   Logic for displaying overall and individual placement progress on Карточки заявок (lines 22783, 22810, 22827) was updated to derive progress directly from the  status of  within each , ensuring accurate counts.
    *   The Детальное размещение modal's progress display (lines 33362, 33473) was also updated to use the accurate  data for  statuses.
    *   The frontend was restarted after these changes. The user explicitly stated, Нет, я протестирую интерфейс сам (No, I will test the interface myself), indicating that frontend verification is now with the user.
