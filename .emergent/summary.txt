The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the TAJLINE.TJ cargo management system. Initially, the engineer focused on critical fixes and feature enhancements related to warehouse layout visualization, accurate cargo placement display, and fixing data inconsistencies between  and  collections. This involved extensive backend API modifications in  to ensure accurate data aggregation for warehouse statistics and cargo placement progress, and corresponding frontend updates in . A significant part of the work involved debugging discrepancies between backend API responses and frontend display, especially concerning placed cargo counts and warehouse schemes. The engineer meticulously addressed user feedback, iterated through testing and code adjustments, and successfully resolved complex data synchronization issues. The latest work transitioned to implementing a new major feature: –†–∞–∑–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≥—Ä—É–∑–æ–≤ –Ω–∞ —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç (Cargo placement on transport), starting with QR code generation for vehicles.

The TAJLINE.TJ application is a cargo management system for Moscow-Tajikistan routes, supporting Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles, aiming to streamline the cargo lifecycle. Initial features included Cargo Acceptance & QR Management, Cargo Placement (Scanner), Placement Progress & Analytics, and –†–∞–∑–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –≥—Ä—É–∑ (Placed Cargo) viewing. Recent trajectory updates focused on enhancing the –ü—Ä–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä —Å—Ö–µ–º—ã —Å–∫–ª–∞–¥–∞ (View Warehouse Scheme) with interactive, accurate cargo display, detailed information on cell click, and cargo removal. Key fixes included correcting warehouse card statistics, allowing placement of unpaid cargo, displaying cargo names on QR scan, filtering fully placed requests from Ready for Placement, and ensuring accurate placement data on –ö–∞—Ä—Ç–æ—á–∫–∏ –∑–∞—è–≤–æ–∫ (Request Cards). The latest user request outlines a new major feature for generating QR codes for transports and managing cargo placement onto them, including scanning, status updates, and logging.

        -   ****: Extensively refactored to fetch placement data from both  and  collections, including handling  cases. Enhanced to return comprehensive cargo details and a flat  list for frontend consumption, addressing synchronization issues.
        -   ****: Modified to accurately calculate  and  for –ö–∞—Ä—Ç–æ—á–∫–∏ –∑–∞—è–≤–æ–∫ based on  and to correctly filter out fully placed requests.
        -   ****: Updated to filter fully placed requests and ensure the response structure includes  for frontend compatibility.
        -   ****: Improved logic to parse , fetch , , and  from related collections and current operator data. Implemented  for dynamic  resolution based on delivery city and actual database warehouses.
        -   **NEW Transport QR Endpoints**: Added , , , and  to manage QR code generation, retrieval, printing, and listing transport status. Updated  model with , , ,  fields.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The primary React component managing application routes, global state, and UI rendering. It communicates with the backend APIs.
    -   **Changes Made in this Trajectory**:
        -   **Warehouse Layout Modal ()**: Enhanced to display detailed cargo information from the  API response.
        -   **–ö–∞—Ä—Ç–æ—á–∫–∏ –∑–∞—è–≤–æ–∫ Display**: Updated logic to correctly reflect  and  by synchronizing with backend  flags for .
        -   **–î–µ—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ Modal**: Updated to display comprehensive cargo, operator, and warehouse information fetched from the  API.
        -   **Transport List UI**: Added state variables for transport QR modals (, ) and functions (, , ) to interact with new backend QR endpoints.
        -   **Transport Card**: Integrated UI elements (e.g., QR status indicator, Generate QR button) into the transport list view.
        -   **NEW Transport QR Modal**: A new  component () was added for displaying QR codes and printing options for transports.

Following the successful backend implementation and testing, the engineer then began implementing the frontend components in . This involved:
1.  Adding new state variables for managing transport QR modal visibility (, ).
2.  Implementing JavaScript functions (, , ) to interact with the newly created backend QR APIs.
3.  Updating the existing transport list UI to include buttons for generating and printing QR codes, and displaying a QR status indicator.
4.  Adding a new  component () to serve as the modal window for displaying and managing transport QR codes.

The last action was successfully adding the  to  and restarting supervisor services. The immediate next step is to test these frontend components to ensure the QR code generation and display functionality is working as expected in the UI.
