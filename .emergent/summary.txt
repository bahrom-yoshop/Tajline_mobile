The AI engineer's work has primarily focused on extending the TAJLINE.TJ application by systematically adding a comprehensive courier management system. Following an initial phase of critical bug fixes, including resolving  value errors and addressing backend enum mismatches, the focus shifted entirely to implementing the user's detailed requests for a courier service. This involved extensive modifications to both backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) code, covering data model enhancements, new API endpoints, and a complete UI overhaul for cargo acceptance and courier-specific dashboards. The process has been iterative, characterized by feature phased implementation (cargo form, courier system, courier personal account), continuous testing, and diligent debugging of issues like session instability and permission errors, often leveraging the  for complex problems. The work is currently in progress on refining the courier's personal account UI.

The TAJLINE.TJ application is a full-stack cargo management system designed for Moscow-Tajikistan routes, supporting Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles. It handles cargo lifecycle, unique numbering, QR scanning, RBAC, financial tracking, and notifications.

Initial recent feature development aimed to:
1.  **Refine QR Scanning**: Fix QR груз не найден errors, ensure camera initialization, adjust camera/simulator size, and prevent duplicate notifications.
2.  **Enhance Placement UI**: Add close scan buttons, show cargo info panels, and display session statistics for mobile placement.
3.  **Integrate External Scanner**: For desktop Размещение, enable external barcode/QR scanning for auto-filling cargo/cell data with step-by-step UI.
4.  **Improve Cell QR Generation**: Generate cell QR codes in Б1-П1-Я1 format, include occupancy checks, and add a Generate QR by Piece button.
5.  **Refine Cell QR Readout**: Ensure scanned cell QR data (Б?-П?-Я?) displays accurately, auto-fills, and persists in input fields.
6.  **Warehouse/Cell ID System**: Automatically generate unique IDs for warehouses, blocks, shelves, and cells, using these for QR generation but displaying human-readable format for printing.
7.  **New Warehouse Creation Page**: A dedicated admin UI for warehouse creation (Name, Address, Operator, Block/Shelf/Cell counts) with QR generation options.

Current development focuses on a comprehensive **Courier Management System**:
1.  **Cargo Acceptance Form Enhancement**: Add Забор груза (pickup address, date/time), Способ получения груза (self-pickup/home delivery), Стоимость курьерских услуг, and an Отправить курьером button.
2.  **Courier System Implementation**: Introduce a new  role, implement an admin panel for courier registration, listing, history, status, and profile editing.
3.  **Courier Personal Account**: Develop a dedicated courier interface with a sidebar menu, a Новый заявку (new requests) section displaying cargo cards with detailed sender and pickup information, and a modal with Принять, Редактировать, Генерировать и печать QR Код, and Отменить заявку actions.
4.  **Expanded Courier Workflow**: Introduce Принятый груз (accepted cargo) and Забранные грузы (picked up cargo) categories. Implement Забрать груз and Сдать груз buttons to manage cargo status transitions.
5.  **Operation History & Enhanced Editing**: Add История операции (operation history) to cargo cards. Enable couriers to edit and fill in remaining cargo details (name, weight, recipient, payment, calculation, QR/invoice print, save) for picked-up cargo.
6.  **Courier UI Refinements**: Implement information buttons with counts on the main courier dashboard (New Requests, To Pick Up, To Deliver, Notifications). Add a Чат (chat) button to the sidebar. Replace user names with a logo in the menu and header. Enable clicking on FIO (Full Name) in the sidebar to open a user profile for editing details and password.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on enhancing the courier's personal account interface. The specific task being addressed was point 4 of the latest user request: при нажатие на ФИО из боковое меню откроем профил ползователя для изменение всех даный и пароль.

The engineer has already implemented the following:
1.  **State Management**: Added the  state variable in  to control the visibility of the profile editing modal.
2.  **Event Handlers**: Created  and  functions in  to manage the opening of the modal, pre-filling data, and handling profile updates.
3.  **UI Integration**: Modified the sidebar menu ( component) to make the Профиль button (and implicitly the user's FIO display) trigger the  function, which in turn opens the profile modal.

The current state is that the necessary state variables, functions, and UI triggers are in place for the courier profile modal. The AI engineer is in the process of defining the actual JSX structure and content of this  (modal) component, and the last action was finding the appropriate location to insert this new modal component within .
