The AI engineer adopted an iterative development approach guided by user feedback. Initially, the focus was on improving the cargo acceptance form to handle multiple cargo items with a calculator, including individual pricing per item. This involved significant backend model and API updates, alongside frontend UI redesign and state management. Subsequently, the engineer worked on enhancing the admin panel by introducing unique user numbers, implementing user role management (specifically changing operator to admin), and creating detailed user profiles with historical data and a quick cargo creation feature. Throughout these tasks, the engineer meticulously debugged issues, including Pydantic validation errors, incorrect frontend data rendering (like ), and persistent login/session problems. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively troubleshooting a critical session management issue, which is hindering further frontend testing of the newly implemented admin functionalities.

The TAJLINE.TJ application manages cargo transportation between Moscow and Tajikistan, covering the full cargo lifecycle. It features user management (Admin, Warehouse Operator, User roles), real-time notifications, warehouse management with visual layouts, and core cargo operations (acceptance, placement, dispatch, tracking). Financials include payment handling.

Recent enhancements added by the previous engineer, based on user requests, include:
1.  **Multi-Cargo Acceptance:** The Accept New Cargo form was enhanced to allow adding multiple cargo items with individual weights and a calculator to compute total weight and cost, initially based on a single price per KG, then refined to support individual prices per cargo item.
2.  **User Numbering:** Individual unique numbers for each user (e.g., USRxxxxxx) were introduced.
3.  **Admin Panel Enhancements:**
    *   Ability for admins to change an operator's role to administrator.
    *   Creation of a personal profile for each user, displaying information and history of cargo requests and dispatches.
    *   Improved user/operator lists in the admin panel to view profiles, history, and enable quick cargo creation from a user's profile with auto-filled sender/recipient details.

    -   **Summary**: Central FastAPI application managing API endpoints, MongoDB interactions, user authentication, RBAC, and notifications.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        *   Introduced  model with  for individual cargo pricing.
        *   Updated  model to accept a list of  objects for multi-cargo support.
        *   Modified  to process multiple cargo items and calculate total cost based on individual .
        *   Added  field to the  model, making it optional for backward compatibility.
        *   Implemented  function.
        *   Updated  and  to assign/handle .
        *   Modified  to ensure  presence.
        *   Added admin API  for changing user roles.
        *   Added user API  for fetching user profile and history.
        *   Implemented advanced search endpoint  to search users, cargo, and warehouses by multiple criteria.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component for global state, routing, UI rendering based on roles, and backend API interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        *   Integrated multi-cargo input form with dynamic addition/removal of cargo items.
        *   Implemented a real-time calculator displaying total weight, total cost, and individual item costs.
        *   Added  state and displayed it in the header.
        *   Added Личный кабинет (Personal Account) to the navigation menu.
        *   Implemented admin UI for user management, including displaying , and buttons for changing roles and viewing profiles.

<pending_tasks>
-   Fix the critical session management issue where the admin session is lost upon navigation.
-   Ensure the Номер (User Number) column is correctly displayed in the users table within the admin panel.
-   Ensure the role management buttons (shield icon) are correctly displayed and functional in the users table within the admin panel.
-   Address permission system fixes for the admin profile view.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the admin panel functionalities and ensuring their correct display and operation in the frontend.

Specifically, the engineer had just completed (or nearly completed) the following:
1.  **User Number Generation and Display**: Backend was updated to generate unique  for new and existing users, and the frontend () was modified to display this number in the header and attempts were made to display it in the user table.
2.  **User Role Management**: Backend API was added for changing user roles, and frontend UI was implemented to expose this functionality (modal for role change).
3.  **Personal Account/User Profile**: Backend endpoints were added to retrieve detailed user profiles and their cargo history. Frontend UI was implemented to show this Личный кабинет with relevant data.
4.  **Quick Cargo Creation from User Profile**: Backend logic for quick cargo creation was likely enhanced, and a button was added to the frontend user profile views to initiate this.
5.  **Advanced Search System**: Backend models and API endpoints for a comprehensive multi-criteria search (users, cargo, warehouses) were implemented, and the frontend search UI was updated to leverage this.

**Current Problem and Nuances**:
The most recent interaction indicates a critical blocking issue:
*   The admin session is being lost upon navigation, preventing proper testing and usage of the newly implemented admin features. This is the primary blocking issue.
*   The Номер column is not displayed in the user table, and the role management buttons are not visible. This suggests either a rendering issue or a permission/data loading problem in the frontend for these specific UI elements, potentially related to the session issue.
*   Although backend tests for user number generation and role changes were largely successful, the frontend issues are preventing full verification.
