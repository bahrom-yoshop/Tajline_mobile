The AI engineer's work trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to evolving the TAJLINE.TJ application. It began by inheriting an MVP, then systematically addressed major feature enhancements and critical bug fixes. Key phases included implementing a comprehensive ID numbering system for warehouse entities (warehouses, blocks, shelves, cells) across both backend and frontend, which involved updating data models, API endpoints, and QR generation/parsing logic. Subsequently, efforts shifted to enhancing the warehouse creation user experience by designing a new dedicated UI page. A critical turning point was identifying and tackling persistent session instability issues, requiring meticulous debugging of token validation, API error handling, and React  dependencies. The process involved iterative code modifications, backend and frontend testing, and direct user feedback, with the current focus on verifying the session stability improvements.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application is a full-stack cargo management system, streamlining operations for Moscow-Tajikistan routes. It supports Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles, covering the cargo lifecycle from acceptance to delivery, including unique numbering, barcode/QR scanning, RBAC, financial tracking, and notifications.

Recent feature development included a mobile-centric Операции section with Поиск груза, Генерация и печать QR код, Размещение, and Приём груз. The primary goals were:
1.  **Refine QR Scanning:** Fix QR груз не найден, ensure camera initialization, fix camera/simulator size, prevent multiple notifications.
2.  **Enhance Placement UI:** Add close scan buttons, show info panels with cargo data, and session statistics for mobile placement.
3.  **Integrate External Scanner:** For desktop Размещение, enable external barcode/QR scanner for auto-filling cargo/cell data with step-by-step UI and status indicators.
4.  **Improve Cell QR Generation:** Generate cell QR codes in Б1-П1-Я1 format, add occupancy checks, and a Generate QR by Piece button.
5.  **Refine Cell QR Readout:** Ensure scanned cell QR data (Б?-П?-Я?) displays accurately, auto-fills, and persists in input fields.
6.  **Warehouse/Cell ID System:** Automatically generate unique IDs for warehouses, blocks, shelves, and cells upon creation. Use these IDs for QR code generation, but for printing, display the human-readable Б?-П?-Я? format only.
7.  **New Warehouse Creation Page:** Implement a dedicated UI for administrators to create warehouses, including fields for Name, Address, Operator selection, Block/Shelf/Cell counts, and integrated buttons for generating QR codes for all cells or specific cells (with Б-П-Я input).

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a standard full-stack architecture:



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend, handling API endpoints, MongoDB interactions, user authentication (JWT), and RBAC.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file received significant updates to integrate the new ID system for warehouse entities.
        *   **Data Models**: Updated , , ,  models (or similar structures) to include new uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) fields.
        *   **ID Generation**: Added helper functions for automatic ID generation (e.g., UUIDs).
        *   ****: Modified to auto-generate IDs for the warehouse and its nested blocks, shelves, and cells upon creation.
        *   ****: Updated logic to use the newly generated IDs for cell QR code generation.
        *   ****: A new endpoint was implemented to support cell occupancy checks, addressing a pending task.
        *   ** (function logic)**: Updated to work with the new ID-based system for cargo placement.
        *   **Duplicate Code Removal**: Cleaned up duplicated or unreachable code segments related to placement logic.
        *   **Token Expiry**: Verified  was 1440 (24 hours), confirming backend token validity was not the issue for session instability.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The central React component managing global state, routing, UI rendering, and all backend interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file was extensively modified for multiple features and fixes.
        *   **Cell QR Parsing/Scanning**:  was updated to correctly parse and handle the Б1-П1-Я1 format, and  was modified to use this updated parsing and ensure  persisted.
        *   **Cargo Placement**:  was adjusted to work with the new ID system.
        *   **Cell QR Generation (Frontend)**:  was updated to align with the new ID-based QR generation from the backend.
        *   **Warehouse Creation UI**:
            *   New state variables were added (, , , , , ).
            *   Functions like  and  were introduced.
            *   The Создать склад button was modified to open a new dedicated modal/page ( component).
            *   A new  component was added to host the new warehouse creation form, including inputs for warehouse details and counts for blocks, shelves, and cells.
        *   **Session Stability Fixes**:
            *   Refactored  dependencies related to , , ,  to prevent aggressive 401 logouts and infinite loops.
            *   Modified the  wrapper to handle 401 errors less aggressively and fixed a lint error related to .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively working on resolving critical session instability issues within the frontend application, specifically in . This problem was identified during frontend testing, which reported that the application works on 75% but has a critical problem with session instability.

The specific actions taken include:
1.  **Refactoring  dependencies:** The engineer reviewed and modified the dependencies of  hooks responsible for token validation, user data fetching (), and logout procedures (). The goal was to prevent infinite rendering loops and overly aggressive 401 (unauthorized) logouts that were leading to session termination after short periods.
2.  **Improving  error handling:** The  wrapper function was made less aggressive in its handling of 401 HTTP errors. An identified lint error related to an undefined variable () within this function was also fixed to ensure proper token handling.
3.  **Adjusting  logic:** The function responsible for validating JWT tokens () was updated to include a buffer time, ensuring that tokens are not prematurely marked as invalid, which contributes to session persistence.

The current state is that these code modifications have been applied, and the engineer is poised to test these specific fixes to confirm that the session stability issues have been resolved.
