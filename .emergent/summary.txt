The previous AI engineer successfully addressed a wide range of critical bugs and feature enhancements for the TAJLINE.TJ cargo management system. The trajectory shows a systematic approach to debugging, starting with UI stability and data consistency, then moving to core business logic issues like cargo processing, courier management, and map integration. A significant effort was made to resolve persistent  errors in Yandex Maps components, followed by fixing complex backend logic related to notification processing, cargo duplication due to non-unique IDs, and nuanced user authentication flows. The engineer meticulously tackled issues ranging from incorrect calculations in frontend forms to ensuring proper data synchronization across lists. The final work involved comprehensive enhancements to the cargo acceptance form and the introduction of a new UI element for reviewing processed requests.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application is a full-stack cargo management system facilitating cargo routes between Moscow and Tajikistan for Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles. It offers features like cargo numbering, QR scanning, RBAC, financial tracking, and real-time notifications.

Recent explicit requirements and implemented features include:
1.  **UI Stability & Data Consistency**: Ensure UI renders only after data is fully loaded; resolve UI flickering and stale dashboard data.
2.  **Operator Registration & Dashboard**: Fix warehouse selection in operator registration and accurately display real-time warehouse statistics.
3.  **Courier Management**: Implement soft deletion for couriers, allowing admins to view and reactivate inactive couriers.
4.  **Cargo Pickup Workflow**: Integrate a Yandex Map into the Cargo Pickup form to display routes and distances from the warehouse to the pickup address, saving this info with cargo data.
5.  **Cargo Processing Fixes**: Resolve errors in Send to Placement (notification ID, pickup request not found) and Accept Cargo (already processed notification, cargo duplication).
6.  **Deletion Functionality**: Enable correct deletion of pickup requests and implement a force delete option for transports with associated cargo.
7.  **User Authentication Feedback**: Display user status (blocked/deleted) and informative error messages (wrong login/password) via modals upon login attempt.
8.  **Cargo Acceptance Form Enhancement**: Correct total sum calculation, filter warehouse selection to exclude the operator's warehouse, and display cargo route information on accepted cargo cards.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a standard full-stack setup: FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Centralized FastAPI application logic, defining API routes, handling data models (Pydantic), and interacting with MongoDB.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Courier Management**: Added endpoints for soft deleting couriers (), listing active/inactive couriers, activating (), and permanently deleting couriers ().
        -   **Warehouse Management**: Updated models and endpoints to include full warehouse addresses, and added a temporary update endpoint for existing addresses.
        -   **Pickup Request & Cargo Handling**: Introduced endpoints for individual pickup request deletion ( and ). Modified cargo creation logic () to use UUIDs for unique notification/cargo IDs, and incorporated route information (source/destination warehouses). Adjusted  and  to support old/new notification ID structures and allow processing of / statuses.
        -   **Transport Management**: Defined a less strict  endpoint to allow force deletion of transports with cargo.
        -   **Authentication**: Enhanced  to return detailed error messages for , , and  statuses.
        -   **Cleanup**: Added a temporary endpoint  to remove duplicate notifications.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component, managing global application state, handling routing logic, and rendering the primary UI based on user roles and application state.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **UI Stability**: Implemented  and  states with  to prevent UI flickering.
        -   **Operator Dashboard**: Corrected logic to display actual warehouse statistics instead of hardcoded data.
        -   **Courier Management**: Integrated UI for courier soft deletion (delete button,  switch) and added sections/logic for displaying and managing inactive couriers (activate/permanent delete buttons).
        -   **Route Map Integration**: Imported and integrated  component into the cargo pickup form, passing  to backend, and ensuring  is correctly passed.
        -   **Error Handling & Modals**: Refactored  to pass full structured error objects from the backend, disabling default alerts for auth-related errors. Implemented  and  states and corresponding  components to display detailed user status (blocked/deleted) and login errors (wrong password/user not found) instead of generic alerts. Addressed React state batching issues with  and  to ensure modals render.
        -   **Cargo Acceptance Form**: Corrected cargo item sum calculation (weight * price). Modified warehouse selection to filter out the operator's current warehouse and added a descriptive label for warehouse selection logic. Updated  to pass source and destination warehouse details. Added route information display to cargo cards.
        -   **List Synchronization**: Ensured  and  are called correctly to update active/inactive courier lists after activation/deletion actions, ensuring real-time synchronization.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/RouteMap.js**:
    -   **Summary**: A React component responsible for initializing and rendering a Yandex Map, displaying routes, and calculating distances.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just completed a series of critical fixes and enhancements across the TAJLINE.TJ application. The last significant block of work focused on enhancing the –ü—Ä–∏—ë–º –∑–∞—è–≤–∫—É (Accept Cargo Request) form used by warehouse operators.

Specifically, the engineer addressed three main issues within this form:
1.  **Incorrect Total Sum Calculation**: The total payment sum displayed was incorrect, only summing prices instead of calculating . This was fixed in  around line 23504.
2.  **Warehouse Selection Logic**: The warehouse dropdown was showing all warehouses, including the operator's current warehouse (which should be the source). The logic was modified to only display destination warehouses, excluding the operator's assigned warehouse. A descriptive label was added to clarify this logic to the operator. This involved changes in  around lines 23520-23580 and the  function around line 1780 to pass source and destination warehouse IDs.
3.  **Route Information Display**: The requirement was to show the cargo's route (from source warehouse to destination warehouse) on the cargo card in the Cargo Placement list. This involved saving the  in the backend (, around line 14550 in the  endpoint) and displaying it in the frontend (, around line 18400) using a badge like üìç –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ –°–∫–ª–∞–¥ ‚Ññ1 ‚Üí –•—É–¥–∂–∞–Ω–¥ –°–∫–ª–∞–¥ ‚Ññ2.

All these changes were successfully implemented and tested, with the backend testing confirming 100% success for these fixes. The system is currently in a state where these critical aspects of the cargo acceptance workflow are functioning correctly.

The very last user request, and thus the immediate next task, is to add a new button after the –ù–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥–Ω–∞—è (Invoice) button that will open a modal to view or edit the details of an already accepted notification. This implies reusing the existing cargo acceptance modal or a similar component, but for historical data rather than new acceptance.

Add a new button near the –ù–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥–Ω–∞—è button that opens a modal to view/edit details of an already accepted notification.
