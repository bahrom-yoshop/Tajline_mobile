The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the TAJLINE.TJ application from a basic MVP to a more feature-rich cargo management system. The development followed an iterative process, primarily driven by user feedback and bug reports. Key feature additions included a complete courier management system, real-time GPS tracking with history and ETA, an enhanced cargo pickup request form, and a new Cargo Pickup section for operators. The engineer meticulously addressed various issues, from logical discrepancies in data handling (e.g., separate collections for requests, incorrect status filtering, missing ) to frontend rendering bugs (e.g.,  error due to duplicate IDs, UI display logic for different request types). The work involved significant modifications to both FastAPI backend endpoints and React frontend components, demonstrating a strong grasp of full-stack development. The trajectory shows a cycle of feature implementation, testing, user feedback, and bug fixing.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application is a full-stack cargo management system for Moscow-Tajikistan routes, supporting Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles. Its core purpose is to manage the cargo lifecycle, including unique numbering, QR scanning, RBAC, financial tracking, and notifications.

Recent feature development aimed to:
1.  **Courier Management System**: Introduce a  role with admin panel for registration, listing, history, status, and profile editing.
2.  **Cargo Acceptance Form**: Enhance form for  with pickup address, datetime, method, courier service cost, and Send to Courier button.
3.  **Courier Personal Account**: Develop a dedicated interface with New Requests (cargo cards) and actions (Accept, Edit, QR, Cancel).
4.  **Workflow Expansion**: Add Accepted Cargo and Picked Up Cargo categories with Pick Up Cargo and Deliver Cargo buttons.
5.  **Enhanced Editing & History**: Implement Operation History on cargo cards; enable comprehensive editing for picked-up cargo.
6.  **UI Refinements**: Information buttons, chat section, logo, user profile modal, mobile responsiveness.
7.  **Specific Fixes/Improvements**: Restore button for cancelled requests, Yandex Map integration for new requests.
8.  **Courier Location Tracking**: Implement courier GPS tracking and admin/operator map view.
9.  **Courier History & ETA**: Provide features to view courier movement history and calculate ETA.
10. **Refined Pickup Request Form**: Create a simplified Cargo Pickup mode within Receive New Cargo form for essential pickup details.
11. **Warehouse Delivery Enhancements**: Process delivered pickup requests, show notifications to operators, and display them in Размещенные грузы (Placed Cargo).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with and is currently working on improving the courier's personal account and addressing issues related to saving edited request data and GPS tracking.

Specifically, the most recent work involves:
1.  **Limiting display for Новые заявки (New Requests) and Принятые заявки (Accepted Requests) in the courier interface**:
    *   The aim is to show only 2 addresses and 6 cargo cards by default, with a Показать всех (Show All) button to reveal the rest.
    *   The AI engineer has added  and  states in  to manage this visibility.
    *   Modifications have been made to the JSX rendering logic within  (around lines 18778 and 19070) to apply these limits, and the AI engineer has fixed a JSX parsing error encountered during this process.

2.  **Addressing Ошибка при сохранении (Error on Save) when editing requests**:
    *   This is the next explicit task confirmed by the user. The problem states that when a courier clicks Просмотр заявки (View Request) or Редактирование заявки (Edit Request) from the Принятые заявки section, filling fields, and attempting to save results in an error.
    *   The AI engineer has just started diagnosing this problem, beginning by locating the Просмотр заявки and Редактирование заявки buttons in  (around lines 19221 and 19399) and noting the relevant modal windows (around line 27132). The next step is to examine the associated  and  functions.

The previous work included resolving several critical issues:
*   Fixing the  DOM error by making  IDs unique and updating related QR scanner functions.
*   Correcting  due to incorrect cargo status ( vs. valid enum values).
*   Ensuring  is correctly assigned to cargo created from pickup requests, making them visible to warehouse operators.
*   Implementing the Наименование груза field replacement for Назначение груза across frontend forms and backend processing.
*   Filtering 'completed' pickup requests from the На Забор list.

The current state is that the display limitation for courier requests has been implemented in the frontend, and the AI engineer is actively investigating the saving/editing issue for accepted courier requests.
