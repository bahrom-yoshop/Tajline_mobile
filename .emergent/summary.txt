The previous AI engineer demonstrated a comprehensive and iterative approach to developing the TAJLINE.TJ application. Initially, work focused on backend fixes for user roles, transport management, and inter-warehouse logistics. Subsequent efforts expanded to include enriching warehouse/operator data, improving inter-warehouse transport workflows, and implementing advanced cargo search. A major branding update involved replacing all text branding with a new logo. Critically, a full client cargo ordering system was built, encompassing backend APIs for delivery, cost calculation, and order creation, followed by robust frontend integration. The engineer then systematically addressed Pydantic validation errors, fixed a recurring  error in the frontend by refining API call error handling, and resolved missing UI fields that caused backend validation failures. Throughout the process, persistent session management issues were investigated and significantly improved by adjusting JWT token expiry and refining frontend API error handling. The most recent work involved implementing a dynamic cargo numbering system and a payment tracking system for accepted client orders, which is currently undergoing testing and refinement.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application is designed as a comprehensive web platform for cargo transportation between Moscow and Tajikistan, managing the entire cargo lifecycle. It features robust User Management (Admin, Warehouse Operator, User roles with RBAC), real-time Notifications, and detailed Warehouse Management (creation, visual layouts, QR code integration for cells). Core Cargo Operations include acceptance, placement, dispatch, return, and historical tracking using unique 4-digit cargo numbers and a Cargo Name field. A Logistics System handles transports, and Financials manage payments. Recent enhancements expanded to include detailed operator binding and tracking, universal search by various cargo/user details, a QR code system for cargo/cells, efficient cargo placement, display of operator info on warehouse cards, extended operator personal cabinet functionality, refined inter-warehouse transport creation, advanced cargo search, and a complete client cargo ordering system with cost calculation and additional services. Current work also includes client order notifications with read/edit capabilities, route-based default declared values for cargo, dynamic 4-10 digit cargo numbers, and unpaid order management.

<pending_tasks>
-   Completely resolve the session management issue that causes automatic logouts during form submissions and navigation for users.
-   Investigate and fix the issue where the Рассчитать стоимость (Calculate Cost) button remains disabled in the client cargo order form.
-   Verify (test) the recently implemented changes to the cargo number generation logic.
-   Verify (test) the recently implemented unpaid orders API endpoints and their integration.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on two new user-requested features:
1.  **Individual Cargo Number Generation (4-10 digits):** The  function in  was updated to support this variable length. During initial testing, an issue was found where the generated numbers used the current month (August, ) instead of January () for consistency, which was then corrected.
2.  **Unpaid Orders Management:** This involved creating a new  Pydantic model in  to track accepted cargo requests that are awaiting payment. The  API endpoint was modified to automatically create an  entry when an admin accepts a client's cargo request. New API endpoints were also added for administrators to view all unpaid orders and to mark a specific order as paid (). An issue was identified where the  endpoint expected  as a separate URL parameter instead of within the request body, which was then rectified.

The last action performed was fixing the identified issues with cargo number generation and the  API parameter. The system is now ready for re-testing of these specific functionalities.
