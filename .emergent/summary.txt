The previous AI engineer demonstrated a highly iterative, user-feedback-driven approach to enhance the TAJLINE.TJ cargo management system. The development trajectory spans multiple critical bug fixes and feature additions, moving the application from an MVP state to a more robust, production-ready system. Key areas of focus included resolving data inconsistency issues across the frontend (e.g., warehouse statistics, scheme visualization, reports), improving the user experience for cargo and cell management (e.g., new modal, QR code generation and printing), and refining core workflows like cargo placement via scanner. The engineer efficiently identified root causes, often involving discrepancies between frontend data handling and backend API responses, and implemented full-stack solutions. The work concluded with a fully functional and integrated cargo placement system using QR scanners, handling various cargo and cell ID formats.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application is a comprehensive full-stack cargo management system designed for Moscow-Tajikistan routes. It supports Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles, managing the entire cargo lifecycle, including unique numbering, QR scanning, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), financial tracking, and real-time notifications.

Recent development focused on:
1.  **Warehouse Management**: Enhancing real-time statistics display, implementing a detailed cell management modal (with add/edit/delete blocks/shelves/cells, individual/batch QR generation and printing), and ensuring data consistency across various warehouse-related views (dashboard, warehouse cards, scheme visualization, and reports).
2.  **Cargo Placement Workflow**: Refining the two-step scanning process for cargo placement (scan cargo QR, then scan cell QR), supporting various QR code formats for both cargo and cells, and implementing an automatic, continuous scanning workflow for efficiency.
3.  **UI/UX Improvements**: General refinements across the application, addressing specific display bugs, and simplifying operator workflows by removing redundant UI elements.
4.  **Backend Enhancements**: Creating and modifying API endpoints to support new frontend features and ensure accurate data retrieval and processing.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component handling global state, routing, and all major UI interactions.
    -   **Key Changes**:
        -   **Warehouse List Display ()**: Corrected data parsing to handle direct array response from , fixing the issue where warehouses weren't displayed.
            
            *Importance*: Ensured warehouse list populated correctly.
        -   **Warehouse Card Statistics**: Replaced  and hardcoded values for Клиентов and Сумма with actual  and  from .
        -   **Removed Размещенные грузы**: Deleted the Placed Cargo subcategory from the menu and its corresponding rendering block (lines 16381-16834) to optimize site load.
        -   **Cell Management Modal**:

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully addressed comprehensive issues related to the cargo placement functionality via scanner and camera. The user reported two main problems:
1.  **Scanner not reading pickup cargo QR codes**: The system failed to identify QR codes generated for cargo pickups, specifically those containing JSON data or in older formats.
2.  **Cell QR code format not accepted**: The scanner did not recognize the newly implemented compact numeric cell QR codes (e.g., 03010101) during the second step of placement, reporting an invalid format.
3.  **No automatic transition between scanning steps**: The workflow required manual intervention to move from scanning a cargo item to scanning its destination cell, and then to the next cargo item, making the process inefficient.

The AI engineer's actions involved a full-stack approach:
-   **Backend Fix ()**: The  endpoint was enhanced to support various cargo number formats, including parsing JSON data from pickup QR codes and recognizing older  formats, ensuring that  was correctly populated.
-   **Frontend Fixes ()**:
    -    was updated to correctly interpret the new 03010101 cell QR format, alongside retaining compatibility with previous formats.
    -    was improved to accurately extract cargo and request numbers from diverse QR code data structures, including JSON.
    -   The  function was significantly refactored to enable a seamless, automated two-step scanning process: after a successful cargo scan, it automatically prompts for a cell scan; upon successful cell scan and placement, it clears the current scan data and immediately prepares for the next cargo item, or closes the modal if all items are processed.

The work concluded with all scanner and placement functionalities working perfectly, supporting multiple QR code formats and an efficient, automated workflow for operators.
