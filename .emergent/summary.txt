<analysis>
The AI engineer has comprehensively extended the TAJLINE.TJ application, moving from initial bug fixes to a robust courier management system. The work trajectory demonstrates an iterative, user-driven development process. Key achievements include integrating Yandex Maps for pickup addresses, implementing real-time courier GPS tracking for both couriers (self-tracking) and admin/operators (monitoring), adding courier movement history and ETA calculation, and significantly enhancing the Receive New Cargo form with a dedicated Cargo Pickup mode. Each feature involved concurrent backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) development, including data model updates, new API endpoints, and UI component creation/modification. The process consistently involved user confirmation and testing, ensuring features met explicit requirements. The focus has been on core functionality delivery, addressing user feedback promptly.

The TAJLINE.TJ application is a full-stack cargo management system designed for Moscow-Tajikistan routes, supporting Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles. Its core purpose is to manage the cargo lifecycle, including unique numbering, QR scanning, role-based access control (RBAC), financial tracking, and notifications.

Recent feature development aimed to:
1.  **Courier Management System**: Introduce a  role with an admin panel for registration, listing, history, status, and profile editing.
2.  **Cargo Acceptance Form**: Enhance the form for  to include pickup address, datetime, method, courier service cost, and a Send to Courier button.
3.  **Courier Personal Account**: Develop a dedicated interface with a sidebar, New Requests section (cargo cards with sender/pickup info), and actions like Accept, Edit, Generate/Print QR, and Cancel Request.
4.  **Workflow Expansion**: Add Accepted Cargo and Picked Up Cargo categories with Pick Up Cargo and Deliver Cargo buttons.
5.  **Enhanced Editing & History**: Implement Operation History on cargo cards; enable comprehensive editing (name, weight, recipient, payment, calculation, QR/invoice print) for picked-up cargo, supporting multiple items and a calculator.
6.  **UI Refinements**: Include information buttons on the dashboard (counts), chat section, logo instead of username, and a user profile modal.
7.  **Specific Fixes/Improvements**: Remove redundant UI elements, rename Accepted Cargo, ensure numeric QR/request numbers, fix request update saving, show all filled info in views/cards, improve mobile responsiveness for login and sidebars, add a Restore button for cancelled requests, and integrate a Yandex Map address block for new requests.
8.  **Courier Location Tracking**: Implement functionality for couriers to send their GPS location and for admins/operators to view real-time courier locations on a map.
9.  **Courier History & ETA**: Provide features to view courier movement history and calculate estimated time of arrival.
10. **Refined Pickup Request Form**: Create a simplified Cargo Pickup mode within the Receive New Cargo form, allowing operators/admins to quickly generate courier requests by filling only essential pickup details (sender info, address, date/time, cost, designation, payment status), hiding other fields.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture:



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend handling API endpoints, MongoDB interactions, user authentication (JWT), and RBAC. It defines data models and business logic.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Data Models**: The  Pydantic model was updated to include  and  fields for real-time tracking. Implicit updates to  for the new pickup form.
        -   **API Endpoints**:
            -   **Existing**:  was implemented to change a cancelled request's status back to 'pickup_requested'.
            -   **New**:
                -    (POST): Allows couriers to send their current GPS coordinates, speed, heading, and current request details. This endpoint now also saves a history of these locations to a new  MongoDB collection.
                -    (GET): Retrieves the latest known locations of all active couriers, including  and .
                -    (GET): Fetches the movement history for a specific courier.
                -    (POST): Calculates the estimated time of arrival for a courier.
                -    (POST): Handles the submission of simplified cargo pickup requests from operators/admins, sending them directly to couriers.
        -   **ID Generation**: Confirmed use of  for request IDs.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The central React component managing global state, routing, UI rendering, and all backend interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **State Management**: Added new states like  (for the enhanced cargo reception form),  (an array to manage multiple phone numbers for pickup requests), and  (to control courier's GPS functions).
        -   **API Integration**: New functions were added to interact with the new backend endpoints: , , , , functions for fetching courier history/ETA, and  for the simplified pickup request form.
        -   **UI Modifications**:
            -   **Yandex Map Integration**: Integrated  component into the Новые заявки (New Requests) section, displaying pickup addresses. The Yandex Maps API script was added to .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed implementing a significant feature: an **enhanced cargo pickup request form** for operators and administrators. This involved adding a Забор груза (Cargo Pickup) button to the Принимать новый груз (Receive New Cargo) page. When activated, this mode simplifies the form, allowing operators to fill only essential details for a courier pickup request: sender's full name, multiple sender phone numbers (a new feature), pickup address, date and time, cargo designation, courier service cost, and payment status for the courier service. All other non-relevant fields are hidden to streamline the process.

To support this, a new backend endpoint, , was created in  to handle these simplified requests, routing them directly to couriers. Corresponding frontend logic, including state management for the , functions to manage multiple phone inputs (, , ), and a new submission handler , were implemented in . A JSX parsing error was also fixed during this implementation. Both backend and frontend servers were restarted after the changes.

Prior to this, the AI engineer successfully implemented and tested:
1.  **Yandex Map Integration**: Displaying pickup addresses on a map in the Новые заявки section for couriers ( component and  script).
2.  **Courier GPS Tracking**: Real-time location updates for couriers ( endpoint and  component) and a map interface for admins/operators to view these locations ( endpoint and  component).
3.  **Courier History & ETA**: Backend endpoints (, ) and frontend component () for viewing courier movement history and estimated arrival times.
4.  **Restoring Cancelled Requests**: Backend () and frontend ( and Восстановить button) functionality was also previously completed and backend-tested.

The current state is that the enhanced pickup request form is integrated, and the AI engineer is awaiting user confirmation for the next steps.
