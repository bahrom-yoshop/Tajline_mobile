The previous AI engineer effectively navigated a series of critical bug fixes and feature enhancements for the TAJLINE.TJ cargo management system. The initial focus was on resolving UI flickering and stale data, which involved state management (, ) and  refinements in . This quickly expanded to addressing user-reported issues: a warehouse selection bug during operator registration, incorrect warehouse statistics on the operator dashboard (traced to hardcoded frontend values), and the absence of a courier deletion feature (requiring new backend endpoints and frontend UI).

A significant portion of work then centered on a new Route Map feature for cargo pickup, which required creating a new React component (), integrating it into , and debugging issues with map initialization, marker display, distance calculation, and crucially, resolving React  errors caused by direct DOM manipulation by the Yandex Maps API. The engineer also corrected an issue where the map used an incorrect warehouse address, leading to schema changes in the backend and data updates. The final issue in the trajectory is a persistent  error, indicating ongoing work on the map component's cleanup and rendering lifecycle.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application is a full-stack cargo management system designed for Moscow-Tajikistan cargo routes, supporting Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles with features like cargo numbering, QR scanning, RBAC, financial tracking, and real-time notifications.

Recent development focused on:
1.  **UI Stability**: Resolve UI flickering and stale analytical dashboard data upon page refresh, ensuring data is only rendered once fully loaded and authorized.
2.  **Operator Registration**: Fix errors in the warehouse selection dropdown during operator registration.
3.  **Warehouse Operator Dashboard**: Correctly display real-time warehouse statistics (total cells, occupied, free, occupancy rate, weight, cargo count, clients, total amount) on the operator's personal account dashboard and the Warehouse List section.
4.  **Courier Management**: Add functionality to delete couriers from the list and implement soft delete to hide inactive couriers from the default view, with an option for admins to view all.
5.  **Cargo Pickup Workflow**: Integrate a map feature into the Cargo Pickup form. When an operator enters the pickup address, the map should display a route and distance from the operator's assigned warehouse to the pickup address, with visible markers for both points. This route information should also be saved with the cargo data.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **State Management**: React Hooks (, ) for UI state and data loading.
-   **API Interaction**: RESTful API design,  wrapper.
-   **Frontend Routing**: Managed within  for different user roles.
-   **Mapping Integration**: Yandex Maps API for route calculation and display.
-   **Soft Deletion**: Backend logic to deactivate records rather than permanently delete.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a standard full-stack setup: FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Core FastAPI logic, API routes, and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Courier Management**: Added  to soft delete couriers by setting  to . Modified  to filter for  by default, adding an optional  query parameter.
        -   **Warehouse Management**: Added  field to  Pydantic model and  model for full warehouse address. Updated  to save the . Modified  to return the  field. Added a temporary  endpoint to update existing warehouse addresses for migration/correction.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component managing global state, routing, and UI.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **UI Flickering**: Introduced  and  states. Modified the primary  (around line 5185) and  to manage these states, ensuring UI renders only after data is loaded.  also resets . Conditional rendering added to the main return statement () to show a loading screen or login instead of stale data.
        -   **Operator Registration Form**: Added debug  statements for  array and  data to diagnose warehouse selection issues.
        -   **Warehouse Operator Dashboard**: Added extensive  statements within the operator dashboard statistics display (lines 14640-14690) to debug data discrepancies.  was updated to reset . Hardcoded, fake data for Занято, Свободно, Загрузка, Вес, Количество грузов, Клиенты, Сумма in the  section (lines 19552-19600) was replaced with actual data from .
        -   **Courier Management**: Added  state and a  to trigger  when this state changes. Modified  to accept a  parameter for the backend API call. Implemented  for soft deleting couriers. Added a Delete button to the courier list table ( section around line 22240) and a  component for admins to toggle viewing inactive couriers. Visual indication (opacity) added for inactive couriers in the table.
        -   **Route Map Integration**: Imported  and  components. Added  state to store map data. Integrated  into the Cargo Pickup form (around line 16374), specifically after the Адрес места нахождения груза field in . Removed previous incorrect  integrations. Modified  to include  in the payload and  to clear . Updated  component call to pass  using .

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/RouteMap.js** (New File):
    -   **Summary**: React component responsible for rendering a Yandex Map, displaying a route between two points, and showing distance.
    -   **Changes**: Initial creation and subsequent significant refactoring to handle Yandex Maps API loading, map initialization, marker rendering (A and B points), route calculation, distance display, and robust error handling (e.g.,  errors, API key issues, NaN m distance). Uses  for map interaction. Includes  cleanup for map objects.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/SimpleRouteMap.js** (New File):
    -   **Summary**: A simplified version of  used for debugging Yandex Maps API initialization issues.
    -   **Changes**: Created to isolate and test basic map loading, with minimal routing/marker logic, focusing on resolving API loading problems and  errors through  cleanup.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Thoroughly test and verify the Insufficient permissions error and dashboard reappearance issues for courier roles.
-   Implement the full chat functionality for communication between couriers, admins, and operators.
-   Fully verify the История операций (Operation History) feature on cargo cards for couriers.
-   Frontend testing for the newly implemented enhanced cargo pickup request form (explicitly mentioned as needing further testing).
-   Continue implementing the loading indicators on the main application page to prevent UI flickering on refresh (though significant work has been done, the trajectory ends with a persistent map-related error).
-   Resolve the persistent  error in the  components.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on resolving persistent  errors occurring when the Забор груза (pickup cargo) button was clicked, specifically related to the Yandex Maps integration. This error indicates a conflict where React attempts to remove a DOM node that Yandex Maps API has manipulated directly or removed itself, leading to React losing track of the DOM tree.

The engineer's most recent actions were:
1.  **Diagnosing **: Identified the error as a classic React/direct DOM manipulation conflict, specifically with Yandex Maps API.
2.  **Implementing Cleanup**: Updated the  component (and likely  as the next step) to include proper cleanup functions within  hooks. This involves ensuring that Yandex Map instances and their elements are correctly destroyed or unmounted when the component unmounts or re-renders, preventing React from attempting to remove already-gone elements. The last message confirms the edit was successful for  and the next intended step is to apply the same fix to .
