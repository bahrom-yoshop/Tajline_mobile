The previous AI engineer employed an iterative and user-feedback driven approach to develop the TAJLINE.TJ application. Initially, core functionalities like user roles, transport, and inter-warehouse logistics were established, followed by significant enhancements including a full client cargo ordering system, dynamic cargo numbering, and payment tracking. The engineer systematically debugged issues such as Pydantic validation errors, frontend  errors, and persistent session management problems. Subsequent work focused on improving the cargo lifecycle by implementing detailed status management, a comprehensive pagination system across various data views, and an admin tool for test data cleanup. The most recent efforts centered on enhancing operator warehouse management, specifically displaying associated warehouses, detailing cargo information within cells, and enabling cargo movement. The engineer proactively identified and addressed integration issues between frontend and backend data formats, as evidenced by the ongoing debugging of the warehouse layout displaying cargo based on Cyrillic vs. Latin location formats.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application is a web platform designed to manage cargo transportation between Moscow and Tajikistan, covering the entire cargo lifecycle. Key features include:
*   **User Management:** Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
*   **Real-time Notifications:** For various events within the system.
*   **Warehouse Management:** Creation, visual layouts, and QR code integration for cells.
*   **Core Cargo Operations:** Acceptance, placement, dispatch, return, and historical tracking using unique 4-10 digit cargo numbers and a Cargo Name field.
*   **Logistics System:** Manages transports and inter-warehouse movements.
*   **Financials:** Handles payments for cargo.

Recent enhancements include:
*   Detailed operator binding and tracking.
*   Universal search for cargo/user details.
*   Client cargo ordering system with cost calculation and additional services.
*   Client order notifications with read/edit capabilities.
*   Route-based default declared values for cargo.
*   Unpaid order management with admin view and mark-paid functionality.
*   Enhanced cargo status workflow with –ü—Ä–∏–µ–º, –û–ø–ª–∞—Ç–∞, –ü–µ—á–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π, –†–∞–∑–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ —Å–∫–ª–∞–¥–µ statuses.
*   Filtering in cargo list by –ù–æ–≤–∞—è –∑–∞—è–≤–∫–∞, –û–∂–∏–¥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –æ–ø–ª–∞—Ç–∞, –û–∂–∏–¥–∞–µ—Ç —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ.
*   Ability to accept payment directly from cargo list, changing status to –æ–ø–ª–∞—á–µ–Ω–æ and moving to –û–∂–∏–¥–∞–µ—Ç —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ.
*   Admin function to clean up test data (users, requests, cargo).
*   Pagination system for all tables (cargo list, placement, users) with configurable items per page.
*   Enhanced operator view: displaying only bound warehouses, detailed cargo info in cells within warehouse layout, and enabling cargo movement between cells.

<pending_tasks>
-   Completely resolve the issue where the warehouse layout display does not show all cargo items, specifically those with Latin () location formats due to a backend parsing issue.
-   Fix the functionality to move cargo from one cell to another within the warehouse layout.
-   Ensure that the –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ button in the warehouse list consistently opens the correct warehouse layout modal, addressing any lingering issues with navigating to an incorrect –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∞–º–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å–∫–ª–∞–¥–µ page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the operator's warehouse management functionality. This included:

1.  **Displaying only warehouses tied to the operator**: The  endpoint in  was modified to filter warehouses based on  for the authenticated user, ensuring operators only see relevant warehouses.
2.  **Detailed cargo information in warehouse cells**: A new backend API endpoint, , was implemented in . This endpoint is designed to return the full warehouse structure (blocks, shelves, cells) along with detailed information about any cargo present in each cell.
3.  **Cargo movement functionality**: A backend API endpoint, , was added to facilitate moving cargo from one cell to another.
4.  **Frontend Integration**:  was updated with new states (, , , etc.) and functions (, , ) to support this. The warehouse list UI now has an –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ button to open the layout modal, and the modal itself was updated to display the warehouse scheme with cargo information.

**Current Problem**: The most recent testing revealed a critical issue: while the backend API () *does* return cargo information for some items, the frontend's visual representation of the warehouse layout remains empty for most cargo. The core problem, identified in the last message, is that the backend's parsing logic for  (in ) only correctly processes Cyrillic formats (e.g., –ë1-–ü1-–Ø1). Cargo with Latin formats (e.g., B1-S1-C1) or other descriptions are being ignored by the parsing logic in the  endpoint, preventing them from being mapped and displayed correctly on the warehouse layout in the frontend. The cargo movement functionality is also not fully working, likely due to this underlying display issue.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Modify the backend's  API to correctly parse and recognize both Cyrillic and Latin location formats for cargo within warehouse cells.
