The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles the development of the TAJLINE.TJ application, primarily focusing on enhancing cargo management and fixing critical issues. Initial work involved implementing real-time barcode/QR scanning for cargo placement, integrating  on the frontend and ensuring backend support. A major phase addressed sophisticated cargo placement, introducing filtering for paid cargo, a detailed warehouse analytics modal, and a Placed Cargo section. Throughout, the engineer battled persistent session management bugs and API discrepancies, particularly related to user roles and database connections. Root causes identified included hardcoded database names and phantom duplicate user entries, which were meticulously resolved. The process involved extensive iterative testing, both backend and frontend, demonstrating a robust problem-solving approach. The work concluded with the engineer actively implementing bulk deletion features for the administrator.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application manages cargo transportation from Moscow to Tajikistan, encompassing the entire cargo lifecycle with Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles. Recent enhancements have focused on streamlining cargo operations and administrative control.

The current product requirements and implemented features are:
*   **Multi-Cargo Acceptance:** The Accept New Cargo form now handles multiple items, calculates total costs, and prints TAJLINE-formatted invoices and barcodes. Accepted cargo moves to Cashier -> Unpaid status.
*   **User Numbering:** Users are assigned unique  numbers.
*   **Admin Panel:** Admins can change operator roles, view detailed user profiles with cargo history, and initiate quick cargo creation with auto-filled details.
*   **Extended User Profile:** Users can edit profiles and repeat previous orders with auto-fill.
*   **Admin/Operator Cargo Management:** Features include full user data editing and quick cargo order creation with multi-cargo calculation.
*   **Barcode Scanning for Placement:** Operators use a scanner interface in Cargo Placement to scan cargo barcodes and then bin/shelf/cell QR codes for placement. This now includes real-time camera integration on mobile devices.
*   **Intelligent Placement System:**
    *   **Status Update:** After payment, cargo status updates across all tables, moving from Cashier: Unpaid to Awaiting Placement.
    *   **Enhanced Place Cargo Button:** Clicking Place in Awaiting Placement opens a modal displaying warehouse analytics (blocks, shelves, cells, free/occupied status), allowing selection of *only* free cells.
    *   **Placed Cargo List:** Successfully placed cargo moves to a new Placed Cargo list within warehouses, showing location, and is removed from Awaiting Placement.
*   **Administrator Deletion Functionality:** Admin users need the ability to delete warehouses, cargo applications (заявки), cargo items, regular users, and warehouse operators, supporting single or multiple selections.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing the **administrator's ability to delete multiple entities**. This involves both backend API development for deletion and frontend UI modifications to allow selection and trigger the deletion process.

The current state of this work includes:
*   **Backend Progress**: New backend endpoints for deleting various entities have been started, specifically for **warehouses** ().
*   **Frontend Progress**:
    *   New states for handling multi-selection (, , ) have been added to .
    *   Frontend functions for mass deletion () have been added.
    *   The UI for the **warehouse list** in the admin panel has been modified ( around line 8378) to include **checkboxes** next to each warehouse item and **buttons** to trigger the deletion actions.

The last action recorded was the update of the user list interface () to include mass deletion functionalities, building upon the work already done for warehouses. The engineer is in the middle of integrating the deletion capabilities across different admin entities.
