The AI engineer's work has been an iterative process of extending the TAJLINE.TJ application, primarily focusing on a comprehensive courier management system. Initial efforts involved resolving critical bugs in existing functionalities, such as  value errors and session instability. The bulk of the work then shifted to implementing detailed user requests for the courier service, encompassing backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) modifications. This included enhancing data models, developing new API endpoints for courier and request management, and a complete overhaul of the courier's UI, including dedicated dashboards, forms, and modals. The process involved phased feature additions, continuous debugging, and responsiveness to user feedback, addressing issues like UI visibility, data persistence, QR code generation logic, and integrating new communication features. The work concluded with the implementation of a restore request functionality and an address block for map integration, awaiting frontend testing.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application is a full-stack cargo management system for Moscow-Tajikistan routes, supporting Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles. It manages cargo lifecycle, unique numbering, QR scanning, RBAC, financial tracking, and notifications.

Recent feature development aimed to:
1.  **Courier Management System**: Introduce a  role, implement an admin panel for courier management (registration, listing, history, status, profile editing).
2.  **Cargo Acceptance Form**: Enhance with pickup address/datetime, pickup method, courier service cost, and a Send to Courier button.
3.  **Courier Personal Account**: Develop a dedicated interface with sidebar, New Requests section (cargo cards with sender/pickup info), and a modal for Accept, Edit, Generate/Print QR, Cancel Request actions.
4.  **Workflow Expansion**: Add Accepted Cargo and Picked Up Cargo categories with Pick Up Cargo and Deliver Cargo buttons.
5.  **Enhanced Editing & History**: Add Operation History to cargo cards; enable comprehensive editing (name, weight, recipient, payment, calculation, QR/invoice print) for picked-up cargo, supporting multiple items and a calculator.
6.  **UI Refinements**: Information buttons on dashboard (counts), chat section, logo instead of username in header/sidebar, and user profile modal from FIO click.
7.  **Specific Fixes/Improvements**: Remove redundant UI elements (headers, TAJLINE text, refresh buttons, notification bell icon), rename Accepted Cargo to Accepted Requests, ensure QR codes/request numbers are only digits, fix request update saving, show all filled info in view/cards, improve login form for mobile, adaptive Admin/Operator sidebar, and add Restore button for cancelled requests, and a Yandex Map integrated address block for new requests.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Authentication/Authorization**: JWT, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, React Hooks for state management.
-   **API Interaction**: Standardized  wrapper for backend communication.
-   **Data Modeling**: Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture:



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend responsible for API endpoints, MongoDB interactions, user authentication (JWT), and RBAC. It defines data models and business logic.
    -   **Changes Made**: Received extensive updates to support the courier system.
        -   **Data Models**: , , ,  enums were expanded or introduced. New Pydantic models  and  were added.  was updated with courier-specific fields (, , , , ).
        -   **ID Generation**: A new  function was added to create shorter, human-readable unique IDs for courier requests, replacing UUIDs for display.
        -   **API Endpoints**: Numerous new endpoints were created for courier management (, , , , , , , ). Crucially,  was added to retrieve cancelled requests,  was added for couriers to update request details, and  was implemented to change a cancelled request's status back to 'pickup_requested'.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The central React component managing global state, routing, UI rendering, and all backend interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively modified for the courier system and general UI improvements.
        -   **State Management**: Numerous state variables were added for courier-related data (, , , , , , , ), and form management (, ).
        -   **API Integration**: New  hooks and functions (, , , , , , , , , , , , , ) were added to interact with the new backend courier endpoints.
        -   **UI Modifications**:
            -   **Courier Dashboard**: Refined to remove user data and show only four informational buttons with counts.
            -   **Sidebar/Header**: Integrated  instead of text, added notification badges for new/accepted/picked requests. Renamed Принятые грузы to Принятые заявки.
            -   **Forms & Modals**: Implemented courier profile editing modal, view request modal () displaying comprehensive cargo/payment/sender/recipient info (including multi-item table), and an enhanced edit request modal () with a calculator for multiple cargo items and payment options.
            -   **QR/Request Numbers**: Logic adjusted to display human-readable request numbers from the backend, and QR generation now uses these numerical IDs.
            -   **New Categories**: Added Отмененные заявки (Cancelled Requests) section with a Восстановить button.
            -   **Contact Functionality**: Implemented a Связаться с отправителем button on cargo cards with a modal offering WhatsApp, Telegram, Online Chat, and Call options, with associated handler functions (, , , ).
            -   **Login/Admin/Operator UI**: Login form made responsive for mobile, and the Admin/Operator sidebar menu was updated for better mobile adaptability.
            -   **Map Integration**: An address block was added to Новые заявки designed for Yandex Map integration, intended to show request pickup locations.
        -   **Bug Fixes**: Addressed  component import error. Corrected  naming conflict.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Thoroughly test and verify the Insufficient permissions error and dashboard reappearance issues, especially for courier roles, to ensure complete resolution.
-   Implement the full chat functionality for communication between couriers, admins, and operators.
-   Fully verify the История операций (Operation History) feature on cargo cards for couriers.
-   Complete the Yandex Map integration for the address block in Новые заявки, including actual map display and interaction, potentially requiring an API key.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on two primary features requested by the user:
1.  **Restoring Cancelled Requests**: Implementing a Restore button on the Отмененные заявки (Cancelled Requests) cards. This allows a courier to move a accidentally cancelled request back to the Новая заявка (New Requests) category. The backend endpoint  has been implemented in  (Chat 479-482), and the corresponding frontend function  and the Восстановить button in  have been added (Chat 483-494).
2.  **Address Block with Map Integration**: Adding a dedicated block for pickup addresses within the Новая заявка section, intended for integration with Yandex Maps. This block allows couriers to view addresses, with the future goal of direct map integration. The UI block for addresses has been implemented in  (Chat 495-506).

After implementing both these features, the AI engineer successfully performed backend testing (Chat 507-508) to ensure stability and functionality of the new restore endpoint. The current state is that the code for these features is integrated, and the AI engineer is awaiting user confirmation to proceed with frontend testing.
