The AI engineer iteratively enhanced the TAJLINE.TJ cargo management system through several phases, directly responding to user feedback and evolving requirements. Initially, the focus was on adding warehouse city management features to the FastAPI backend and React frontend, including API endpoints, UI states, and a new modal. This was followed by a major overhaul of the Accept New Cargo form, which involved significant UI/UX improvements like removing redundant fields, adding city autocomplete, integrating quantity and total sum to cargo items, and implementing a comprehensive confirmation modal with QR code generation. The latest work has focused on adapting the UI for various screen sizes (PC/mobile optimization) and, crucially, restructuring the application's navigation for Pickup Requests to create a more intuitive workflow, by removing the Pickup Cargo button from the main form and reorganizing related functionalities into new sub-categories under Cargo menu. The engineer consistently tested backend changes and adapted frontend components.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application is a full-stack cargo management system connecting Moscow and Tajikistan, supporting Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles.

Key explicit requirements addressed and implemented:
1.  **Warehouse City Management**: Add functionality to manage delivery cities associated with each warehouse, including new API endpoints for adding/listing cities and a frontend modal for management.
2.  **Cargo Acceptance Form Refinement**:
    *   Simplify the Accept New Cargo form by removing the Accept Cargo to Warehouse button, Delivery Route, and Destination Warehouse fields.
    *   Enhance Delivery City with an autocomplete feature.
    *   Implement dynamic Delivery Warehouse selection based on the chosen city.
    *   Default Multiple Cargo Types to enabled, and extend its functionality to include Quantity and Total Sum for each cargo item, with overall totals displayed.
    *   Standardize Delivery Method to Self-pickup, Delivery to Recipient City, and Home Delivery.
    *   Remove Print Invoice and Print Barcode buttons.
3.  **Confirmation Modal & QR Generation**:
    *   Introduce a confirmation modal upon submitting cargo acceptance, displaying all entered information and a list of cargo items with their details (name, quantity, weight, price per kg, total sum).
    *   Generate unique QR codes for each cargo item within this modal, formatted as  (e.g., ).
    *   Include buttons in the modal for printing and mass generation of these QR codes, displaying cargo name and number on the QR.
4.  **UI/UX Enhancements & Responsiveness**:
    *   Optimize the application form and confirmation modal for large screens (PC) and mobile devices, improving grid layouts, input field sizes, and overall spacing.
    *   Ensure automatic warehouse selection when a delivery city is chosen.
5.  **Navigation Restructuring for Pickup Requests**:
    *   Remove the Pickup Cargo button from the Accept New Cargo page.
    *   Create a new navigation structure under Cargo: Accept New Cargo, and Pickup Requests (new parent category).
    *   Pickup Requests will contain Process Pickup Request (where the original pickup form functionality will be moved) and For Pickup (the existing For Pickup list moved here).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on the Application Form and QR code generation/printing improvements as per user's requests in Chat Message 489 and 492.

The engineer initiated **Phase 3: Restructuring Navigation (Pickup Request)**.
Specifically, the work involved:
1.  **Removing Pickup cargo button**: The Забор груза button and its associated conditional rendering block were removed from the Принимать новый груз form in  (Chat 498, 500).
2.  **Removing  logic**: All conditional logic and the entire pickup cargo form previously controlled by  were removed from  (Chat 506, 520). This significantly streamlined the cargo acceptance form.
3.  **Restructuring Navigation Menu**: The  array in  (which defines the application's main navigation) was updated. A new parent category, , was introduced under . Under , two new sub-categories,  (Оформить забор груза) and  (На Забор), were defined (Chat 556).
4.  **Adapting Navigation Rendering**: The logic for rendering navigation items in  was updated to correctly handle and display these newly introduced nested sub-sections for both mobile and desktop views (Chat 562, 568).
5.  **Migrating For Pickup list**: The content of the old  tab (the На Забор list) was successfully moved into the new  tab (Chat 588).
6.  **Fixing **: Resolved a linting error by replacing an undefined function call  and undefined  variables with  and  respectively (Chat 594, 599).
7.  **Deleting old tab**: The old  tab content was completely removed from the code (Chat 613).

The very last action taken by the AI engineer was confirming successful compilation after restructuring the navigation (Chat 616). The subsequent user message (Chat 618, 619) indicates moving to other phases, specifically starting with Phase 1: Restructuring form fields for the Address of receipt of cargo.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to move the Адрес получения груза (Recipient Address) field in the application form to appear after the Город выдачи груза (Delivery City) field.
