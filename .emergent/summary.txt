The previous AI engineer demonstrated an iterative and comprehensive development approach for the TAJLINE.TJ cargo transportation web application. Starting from an MVP, the engineer systematically added complex features like detailed logistics, warehouse management with interactive schemes, financial tracking, and a robust notification system. A significant focus was on implementing a 4-digit cargo numbering system and an extensive QR code management system for both cargo and warehouse cells. The work included addressing user-reported bugs, such as a non-functional search header and issues with transport cargo listings, and continuously adapting the backend (FastAPI, MongoDB) and frontend (React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI) to new product requirements. The most recent efforts centered on refining operator role-based access control and inter-warehouse transport logic, indicating a strong commitment to core business logic and security.

<product_requirements>
The TAJLINE.TJ application is a mobile-adaptive web solution facilitating cargo transportation between Moscow and Tajikistan, managing the full cargo lifecycle from booking to delivery.

Key functional requirements include:
-   **User Management:** Supports Admin, Warehouse Operator, and User roles with FIO, phone, password, and role-based access control (RBAC).
-   **Notifications:** Real-time updates for cargo events, unread counters, and user-submitted cargo requests.
-   **Warehouse Management:** Features warehouse creation with defined blocks/shelves/cells, cargo receiving/placement (by 4-digit number), visual layout, interactive cell management (view, move, delete cargo). A future update includes warehouse scheme visualization and QR code integration for cells.
-   **Cargo Operations:** Includes accepting new cargo, detailed listings, placing cargo on transport (by 4-digit number across warehouses), dispatching transports (with automatic cell liberation), detailed history, and a Cargo Name field. Recent work addressed volume validation for dispatch and adding a cargo return to warehouse feature.
-   **Logistics System:** Dedicated section for transport management (Receive Vehicle, List, In Transit, At Destination, History) with driver details and cargo volume. New requirements include transport scheme/volume visualization.
-   **Financials:** Cashier section for payment reception, unpaid cargo lists, and payment history.
-   **Communication:** Contact Us via WhatsApp, Telegram, and online chat.
-   **Operator Binding & Tracking:** Admins bind operators to specific warehouses, limiting their cargo management to assigned locations. Operator FIO is tracked on cargo cards and invoices. Enhanced operator roles include viewing cargo and transports specific to their bound warehouses, and creating inter-warehouse transports.
-   **Search:** Universal search header for admins/operators by cargo number, sender/recipient FIO, phone, and cargo name.
-   **QR Code System:** New feature for generating QR codes for individual cargo items (containing number, name, weight, sender/recipient FIO, phone, city) and warehouse cells. Includes QR scanning functionality and printing of QR labels.
-   **Cargo Placement from Transport:** Allows placing cargo from arrived transports onto warehouses, with automatic warehouse selection based on operator binding, and manual/QR-assisted block/shelf/cell selection.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT for user authentication, role-based access control (RBAC).
-   **UI Frameworks:** Tailwind CSS for styling, Shadcn UI components.
-   **API Design:** RESTful endpoints with  prefix, environment variables for URLs.
-   **Database:** MongoDB, using UUIDs for document IDs.
-   **QR Code Generation:** Python  and  on backend;  on frontend.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.

        *   **QR Code System**: Integrated  and  libraries. Added functions for generating base64 QR code images for cargo (with detailed info) and warehouse cells. Implemented new API endpoints (, , ) for QR operations.  and  now automatically generate QR codes.
        *   **Warehouse Layout & Placement**: Fixed  endpoint to query both  and  collections for comprehensive warehouse scheme visualization. Added endpoints for marking transports as arrived and placing cargo from arrived transports (, ).
        *   **Operator Permissions**: Modified various endpoints to enforce operator-specific access control based on bound warehouses: ,  (target warehouse validation),  (filtered by operator's warehouses), and  (requires access to both source and destination warehouses).
*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively working on fixing critical backend issues related to **operator role-based access control and transport management**, specifically addressing three problems reported after a backend test (Chat Message 422).

The engineer was proceeding with fixing these issues sequentially:
1.  **Problem 1.4 (Cargo Acceptance - Target Warehouse Assignment):** The issue was that the  was incorrectly set to  for admin users when an operator accepts cargo, leading to incorrect warehouse binding. The engineer modified the logic in  to ensure  is correctly assigned for admins (Chat Message 427-429). This fix was applied.
2.  **Problem 1.5 (Transport Filtering for Operators):** The challenge was to ensure operators only see transports relevant to their assigned warehouses. The previous implementation had issues with filtering both standard and inter-warehouse transports correctly. The engineer was modifying the transport search logic in  to correctly filter transports for operators based on their bound warehouses, ensuring all relevant transport types are considered (Chat Message 430-436). This fix was still in progress, with the engineer continuing to refine the filtering logic.
3.  **Problem 1.6 (Inter-Warehouse Transport Creation - Access Control):** This issue involved a flaw in the access control when operators attempt to create inter-warehouse transports. The operator was only checked for access to *one* of the warehouses involved, not both. The engineer identified this specific line () in  and was in the process of correcting the logic to ensure the operator has access to *both* the source and destination warehouses (Chat Message 437-439). This was the very last action in the trajectory, indicating this fix is either just completed or still actively being implemented.

The current state is that the operator permission fixes are in progress, with Problem 1.4 addressed, and active work on Problem 1.5 and 1.6 in the backend (). The application's backend is in a partially fixed state regarding operator permissions.
